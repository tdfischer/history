### Minutes

Jon mentioned that there needs to be more email involvement to keep people's interests and to prep
for what we expect to do once the group becomes more public.

Leading up to the meeting, we mentioned that we wanted to take a look at what should be done now
and start to break the work up so that volunteers could claim the pieces they were interested in.

The following is the list of items we came up with along with the person (if any) that claimed them.

- Curate history of org for replication purposes / storytelling (wiki, Penn, now lives at <https://github.com/akron-io/history>)
- Bullet points of what we want to accomplish, mission statement later (Knapp)
- Quick logo of font with "Akron.io" for now (Eric, unless he doesn't want to)
  - we can focus on something more involved later on
  - use the new logo on website, emails, and discussion board
- Consistent (bi-)weekly email, about planning meeting, about upcoming events (see below for structure)
  - in order to keep people intersted and to prep for when we invite more people, start work on vision for weekly email to members
  - We can talk about other groups once we reach out and build relationship with them instead of adding events for the sake of info
- Work on a basic meeting structure, come up with a checklist of what to cover every planning meeting

#### Jon's original idea for email structure
