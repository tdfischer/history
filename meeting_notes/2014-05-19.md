Minutes:

- Curate history of org for replication purposes / storytelling (wiki, Penn, now lives at <https://github.com/akron-io/history>)
- Bullet points of what we want to accomplish, mission statement later (do this!, Knapp)
- Logo sometime, font with "Akron.io" for now (Eric, unless he doesn't want to)
- Consistent (bi-)weekly email, about planning meeting, about upcoming events (see below for structure)
- Talk about other groups once we reach out and build relationship with them
- Meeting structure, come up with a checklist of what to cover every time

The email structure has the text:

    Headline                      Issue #1
    Blurb text

    Events...  (links to group or Akron.io listing)
