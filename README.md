README - Goals of The History
=============================

History is more than just raw content. It is a story told to help synthesize the events into a form digestible by people not involved in what happened. It helps remind those who are directly impacted by the events, it helps bring people into a story later on, and it helps steer an organization by giving a clear sense of where it has come from.

This source control repository serves two goals. The latest head is the snapshot in time of the history of Akron.io. And the repository changelog itself serves as raw changes that happened over time. The snapshot provides the latest telling of the story, and the changelog give a raw record of the evolution to objectively see the resolution of conflicting parts of the story.

Backstory
=========

Jonathan Knapp had run the Akron/Canton Web Group on meetup.com for the last ... years. Meetup has been a great place to stage events, but as a collector and amplifier of local information, it's missed something. Jonathan started Akron.io as part of an experiment to grow a hub where upcoming events, projects, and companies can see what is going on. The goal is to show off the best that Akron has to offer to both existing and newcomer citizens.

> We're trying to build a community for creative people with a focus on sharing information and combining forces with existing organizations. We are in the very early stages of planning, so feel free to ask questions and offer suggestions.
>
> We have a message board at http://discuss.akron.io where we can collaborate on ideas, share events, and join in the conversation if we're unable to physically attend get togethers.

One of the things we keep re-hashing is our biases toward technologist things. All of us work in tech in some way so we're not as connected with non-techy organizations or events.

Website is important priority because it currently doesn't, you know, say anything. :)
